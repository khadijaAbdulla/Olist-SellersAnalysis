### Scenario
We are a Data analytics team from  Company called Clearpath, hired by Olist, a leading e-commerce platform, to analyze and evaluate the **distribution** and **performance** of sellers across different **States**.

### Objectives
1. What is the **Distribution** of Sellers & Customers in Each State?

4. Where are the **top sellers** Located?

### Analysis & Key Findings
1. Olist has a strong presence in the Home Decor, Health & Beauty, and Car Accessories segments, with a high concentration of sellers. These categories appear to be highly competitive, and Olist needs to ensure that it continues to provide support to sellers in these segments to maintain market competitiveness.
2. We can see in the previous visual that  highly revenue distribution where Seller189 generates the majority of the revenue, accounting for the largest portion in this group. This creates a lack of revenue diversification in Olist.
3.  The resellers make up the bulk of Olist's seller base, comprising about 70% of the total seller count. This suggests that Olist’s market is largely driven by businesses that purchase products for resale rather than by companies that produce them.
4.  We can conclud that resellers dominate in terms of order volume, with a huge gap between them. Resellers contribute the vast majority of orders, while manufacturers account for just 14% of the total orders.This reinforces the earlier finding that resellers are the primary drivers of sales within Olist’s ecosystem, while manufacturers play a much smaller role in the order volume.
5. Manufacturers are likely selling higher-value products or have better profit margins on the products they sell. on the other hand, resellers may be working with lower-cost or lower-margin goods, which explains their higher order volume but comparatively lower revenue.
6. We can conclude that a significant disparity in delivery times across Brazilian states, with AM standing out due to its substantially longer delivery duration. This suggests that logistical challenges or geographical factors in AM contribute significantly to delays in deliveries.
7. The heavy reliance on Organic Search may indicate that sellers believe that visibility through search engines is one of the most efficient ways. The relatively low use of Social Media and Direct Traffic could suggest that sellers are either not effectively leveraging these channels or don't see as much return on investment in those areas.
8. This large variation in results highlights that referral success is not uniform across the seller base. While referrals are clearly an important source of revenue for  many sellers.
9. The chart reveals that the Unknown channel leads by a wide margin, contributing the largest portion of total sales other channels like referrals, email, other, and display ads are much lower, indicating that these channels have less impact on the overall sales performance
10. The previous visual reveals that Car Accessories has the highest ratio of sellers to customers, indicating a highly competitive market where there are many sellers but fewer customers. This may result in intense competition, potentially lowering profit margins for sellers.
11. Manufacturers likely produce or source products at a lower cost and can price them at a higher margin, leading to higher revenue per order,  Resellers typically rely on lower-cost products, and often face higher competition, leading them to price more competitively, which results in smaller profit margins and lower revenue per order.
12. Based on the number of orders, amongst all busniess segments, Health and beauty, watches and househould items are the top performers. Olist needs to continue providing support for sellers in those segments to ensure they maintain their performance. As well as attract new sellers from the same categories to meet the customer’s demand.
13.Lowest performing bueiness segments are Jewlery, perfume, and religious which could be due to issues in the way they display their orders on the website or low customer demand for these categories. Olist needs to focus on these categories and by providing extra support to boost their performance such as improving how products are listed on the website, and utilizing SEO to increase traffic to those specific segments.
